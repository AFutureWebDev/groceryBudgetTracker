Budget Screen: What is your budget? Put in the amount that you would prefer to stay under when shopping for your groceries. After entering in this number, they are redirected to the grocery list page OR the budget amount can be a form input below the header.

When you add an item to your shopping cart and press the checkbox icon on the app, a small window will pop up asking for the price of that item. A running total of what's in your shopping cart will be shown on the screen. If this number gets close to the budget amount, the budget turns yellow, if you are over, it turns red.
